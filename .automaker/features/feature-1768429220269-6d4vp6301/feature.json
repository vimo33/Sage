  "description": "Enable full app functionality without internet connection, with automatic sync when reconnected. Store conversations, journal entries, and insights locally with conflict resolution when syncing.\n\n**Rationale:** Users often want to reflect and journal in environments with poor connectivity (nature, travel, quiet spaces). This ensures the app is always accessible and reliable regardless of network availability.",
